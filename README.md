# Certificate Generator
Small little app I wrote for a client to take a PDF template and automatically add text to it in batch from an Excel spreadsheet. 
The aim is to save time by entering the people details in batch without having to do the certificates one by one.

It's a very small and quick app I did in like 10min, so don't expect much. But it works, and saves about 3 hours of manual work.

ITextSharp, C#, WinForms
